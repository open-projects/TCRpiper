1) add a number of total reads in an experiment (it should depend on a type of using kits)
+ a number of reserved reads for each sample
+ a number of `free` reads in the experiment

2) User ?

3) Dropdown for a project name in the new sample section (maybe create a new section for projects with projects names)
